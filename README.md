# C Programming Notes & Programs

This repository includes anything I thought worth noting and exercising from the book [The ANSI C Programming Language](http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hilder/cs833/Other%20Reference%20Materials/The%20C%20Programming%20Language.pdf).

Book is being mentioned as good introduction to c language by not going into detail but giving enough information on language fundamentals that allows you to go in deep if you would like.
